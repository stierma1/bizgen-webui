The top left inset shows a row of datacenter servers, hallway down the middle and server cabinets on both sides. The top right inset displays a close-up of CPU computer chip. The bottom right inset captures a teaching robot, accompanied by a bunch of smaller student robots.\n\nThe main body of the image contains text that provides information about the AI. It mentions that the AI will only need 1 GPU, but multiple instances can be run accress multiple GPUs. The text also states that the AI will be in production for 50 years. The text is presented in a clean, modern font with a color scheme that matches the overall design of the image. The background of the image is white, which contrasts with the dark green and gold color scheme used for the text and decorative elements. The overall style of the image is professional and designed to convey the AI's production capabilities."
